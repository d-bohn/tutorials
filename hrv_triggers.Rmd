Usually when we analyze HRV data, we are only interested in computing statistics for certain parts
of the HRV time series. Usually a raw ECG file will have an additional channel that outputs a small
electrical charge when certain events are happening. This is done in order to denote which parts of
the sequence are important for analysis.

```{r}
source('R/hrv_tutorial/make_events.R')

make_events('sub1101.RDS', 'data/hrv_tutorial')

```
